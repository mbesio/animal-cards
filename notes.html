  <h1>My HTML notes</h1>

  <h2>Markup</h2>

  <p>
    You have to use markup to tell the browser what to do. <br>
    Otherwise all of what you write in the browser will be displayed as plain text. <br>
    In particular, you can use the em tag to write something in italics, for example: <br>
    <em>Hello, this is an example of the em tag </em>. <br>
    You have opening and close tags, that generally come in pairs, but not always. <br>
    Tags will come in angle brackets, these always come in pairs. <br>
  </p>

  <h2>Tags</h2>
  <p>Now some interesting tags:
    <ul>
      <li>You will use the <strong>br</strong> tag to break a line. </li>
      <li>You will use the <strong>p</strong> tag to have a paragraph element </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Nesting</h2>
  <p>Another important thing for your text is to use appropriately <strong>nesting rules</strong>. <br>
    To use these rules in an appropriate way it is important to not overlap elements. <br>
    Nesting is generally fine, overlapping, not.
  </p>

  <p>Here is also a nested list:
    <ol>
      <li> Jobs out of Uni
        <ul>
          <li>Altran
          <li>OW
        </ul>
      <li> School after Uni
        <ul>
          <li> Academy
          <li> Berkeley
        </ul>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Inline vs. Block</h2>

  <p>
    There is the Inline vs. Block element.<br>
    <strong>div</strong> is the generic block element.<br>
    The div element is used <em>a lot</em> in HTML! So better be comfortable wtih it!
    <strong>span</strong> is the generic inline element.
  </p>

  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>
    For ul (unordered list) and ol (ordered list), you always have to have closing tags. <br>
    Instead, for li (elements of the list), you do not need to have the closing element.
    This is optional and can or cannot be there.
  </p>

  <h2>Optional closing tags</h2>
  <p>
    There are some elements that have optional closing tags:
    <ol>
      <li>List elements
      <li>Paragraph
      <li> I'm sure there are others that I forgot/ I do not know yet
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>URL</h2>
  URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
  When you write url in HTML, write the full form, the absolute URL, strating from http...
  Then ://
  Then a domain name
  Then a file path (can be empty or a single slash)
  <a href="http://www.sampdoria.it"> Doria </a >

  <h2>Images</h2>
  This has no closing tag.
  There are two attributes to this elemet: 1) is the src; 2) is the Alt.
  SRC is the link to the image, Alt is the text that is displayed if the image link cannot be found.
  IMG has no end tag.
  IMG is an inline element. <br>
  Here is the picture of a bear <img src="https://placebear.com/800/600" alt="Picture of a bear">


  <h2>HTML validators</h2>
